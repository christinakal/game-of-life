        <p>
          The Game of Life is a cellular automaton invented in 1970 by British
          mathematician, John Conway. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its
          evolution is determined by its initial state. It consists of a grid of
          cells that can live, die or multiply based on a set of mathematical
          rules. For more info go{" "}

          Any live cell with fewer than two lives the neighbours die, as if by
          underpopulation.

        <div>
          Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next
          generation.

        <div>
          Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by
          overpopulation.

        <div>
          Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell,
          as if by reproduction.
